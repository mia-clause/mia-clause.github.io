  For my Software Engineering course, we had a group project final.  Each group had to design and make a functioning meteor app based off a prompt.  We were able to implement the different topics we learned over the entirety of the course into the project.  Our specific group of six members created a simple app that allows musicians in the Manoa area of Oahu to connect.  Our app was made to be easy to use and visually pleasing.  We used Semantic UI React to build the application and deployed it through Galaxy.
  
  We designed the app to have a main function of finding musician profiles.  Users and admins are able to browse other musicians' profiles.  They can edit their profiles to display contact information, a short bio, and musical skills.  Admins can edit user profiles and delete any posts in case of misconduct.  We also implemented a Jam Sessions page that allows users to post event.  Admins also have the ability to delete anything inappropriate on this page.  Overall the app met the need of growing the music community in Manoa.  
  
  This project taught me a great deal about developing a project with a group.  I found it very difficult to keep up with so many members and to split the work well.  Iv'e learned a lot about project management and what not to do.  This project was a great learning experience.
