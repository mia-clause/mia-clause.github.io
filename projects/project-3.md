This project was a difficult one for me.  Giving characters expression using a graphic arts software proved to be challenging for me.  I was able to create one really well done gothic gamer girl character, however after losing time my other characters fell flat.  They lacked a relaxed look to them.  They came out rigid and boxy, with very little detail.  This was one of the first projects for the class where I lost confidence in my abilities.  I was dissapointed in my work and had to learn how to overcome that frustration.

The project was a great opportunity for me to take advantage of constructive criticism.  I was able to take the notes my professor gave me and apply them to the characters.  This project is still one I am currently improving to help refine my character illustration skills.  My hope is to design great characters to use for future animation projects.
