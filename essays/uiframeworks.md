## Why Use a UI Framework?
After doing some light research I found that one of the main reasons people use UI frameworks is because they often allow someone to build a basic project quickly and in a uniform manner.  Most of the content is already stylized and it allows the developer to tweak and adjust items to their liking with ease.  This makes it easier to pass on the project to future developers. 

Another benefit to using a UI Framework is the efficiency.  Once it is learned, which may take just as much time as learning a whole new programming language, it makes the process of building a project much more efficient.  I personally found that when our classwork switched from using HTML and CSS to Semantic UI, my ability to quickly produce a basic webpage improved.  The code was also easy to read and edit as I went through the process.  I found using Semantic UI to be very beneficial for my coursework and easier once I grasped the main concepts of the framework.    


### Cons to Using a Framework
Honestly I don't know much about the cons of using a UI framework since I've only really been using Semantic UI for a week now.  With the small projects we work on in class using a framework has been nothing but beneficial for my efficiency.  However after reading a few interesting articles from actual developers, the biggest takeaway I have seen is that UI frameworks can become cluttered and messy when trying to customize a lot of details. One online short essay I found particularly interesting was written by Julian Ä†wirko who explains he is a front-end and Javascript developer in Poland.  His article can be found here: [Why do you think that you always need UI framework?](http://julian.io/why-do-you-think-that-you-always-need-css-framework/)
 
His first example on the topic of difficult customization explains how customizing a simple button can be difficult and messy. He also notes how starting to customize many details in a project, it suddenly becomes more work to customize using a UI framework than simply starting with HTML and CSS. I found this very interesting since your automatic assumption would be that something like Semantic UI would help you customize with ease.  And it does, but that customization only goes so far.  

#### Everything is Subjective
So, after reading different opinions online and having a brief introduction to hmtl and Semantic UI, I have come to the conclusion that whether or not to use a UI framework just depends on different things.  Like most debates in our world, its subjective.  Using a framework is based on the preference of the developer, what the project is for, how many people will be working on it, and how simple the project is.  I think using UI frameworks can be very beneficial especially for beginners. But at the end of the day different people like different things.
