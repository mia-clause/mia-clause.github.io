##Why Use a UI Framework?
After doing some light research I found that the opinion of whether a UI framework is more beneficial than simply using HTML and CSS was split.  While there are benefits to using a UI framework, I found that you have to learn just as much as another programming language to use it in a beneficial way.  


After using both HTML, CSS, and Semantic UI, I have found that both are completely usable. The main difference I found was that I worked faster and more efficient with Semantic UI.
